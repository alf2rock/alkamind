excerpt: >-
  I'm not a developer and I used Anthropic Clade Code (CC) and Claude Chat (CCh)
  to build this site. 

  I had a nice long chat with CCh (about architecture and governance and eventually CCh produced the Implementation Guide. 

  I used the Guide with CC (on my vscode terminal CLI) to do the coding, with feedback (in an .md file) from CC back to CCh with an update the log of the journey. 

  CCh then added an addendum of the twists and turns we made along the way. 

  So much fun!


  Sharing it in the hope that it might be useful.
