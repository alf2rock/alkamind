summary: >-
  I'm not a developer and I used Anthropic Claude Code (CC) and Claude Chat
  (CCh) to build this site. I had a nice long chat with CCh about architecture
  and governance, and eventually CCh produced the Implementation Guide. I used
  the Guide with CC (on my VSCode terminal CLI) to do the coding, with feedback
  from CC back to CCh to update the log of the journey. CCh then added an
  addendum of the twists and turns we made along the way. So much fun! Sharing
  it in the hope that it might be useful. 


  EnJoy!

The attached files provide the details for you to follow.

**IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE from Claude Chat (aka CCh)**

Version 6.1 — Decap CMS (Git-Based)

*Zero external dependencies • Content lives in Git • Free
forever*

January 2026



**Follow-up Cheat Sheet (Memo to Self from CC to another AI-Human-Team)**

Now I know I said that I'm not a developer, but I have enough experience to know that whatever happens, it always seems to work out (at best) into a ***Street Fight!*** Thankfully the fun is that it's a metaphor - which is what makes it fun? 

After the Guide finishes then we, Claude Code (aka CC) and myself refined the Decap CMS into a workable config.  We include this because after all the work to get us to the end of the guide, there's always more to do. 

The devils in the detail. 

When the fun was over I asked CC to create a ***Cheat Sheet*** to help another team (AI-Human) navigate through this shallow waters. 

Download the .MD file created by my Claude Code to converse with your CC. 

EnJoy?
