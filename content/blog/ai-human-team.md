summary: >-
  I'm not a developer and I used Anthropic Claude Code (CC) and Claude Chat
  (CCh) to build this site. I had a nice long chat with CCh about architecture
  and governance, and eventually CCh produced the Implementation Guide. I used
  the Guide with CC (on my VSCode terminal CLI) to do the coding, with feedback
  from CC back to CCh to update the log of the journey. CCh then added an
  addendum of the twists and turns we made along the way. So much fun! Sharing
  it in the hope that it might be useful. 


  EnJoy!
