  So part of the evolution of re-tooling and rebuilding in the Age of Ai is to,
  in the words of Matatma Ganhi, "Be the Change you want to see in the world".
  If that works, we should try it. So this is the journal, which might become a
  story some day. 

  I've post the documentation that was use to technically rebuild the site. This post will be a journal of the journey This thread is about the relationships, and the fusing together of various models into a framework that I like to work within.

## If fan comes from fantastic, could fun come from fundamentals?

I've always been intrigued at boiling things down to their fundamental elements. One of my favourite paintings is 
**“The Alchemist Discovering Phosphorus, Joseph Wright of Derby" - Painted in 1771**

This painting cracked me up when I read the story behind it. Joseph depicts a pivotal moment (the discovery of the element phosphorus by the Hamburg alchemist **Hennig Brand** in **1669**) when "our Alchemist" transition from medieval alchemy to modern science in a sympathetic and romantic *light*. The story of Henning Brand is one where, in his quest for the Philosopher's Stone, by boiling a great quantity of urine, he stumbled into phosphorus.  The serendipity of this event is essentially a fusion of **determination and luck**. What our German chemist achieved was the discovery of a fundamental element **P (atomic 15)**. 

How fun is that?

The same fun dynamics are playing out today with yet another **Age of {insert variable of choice]*,*** *but accelerating so fast that the \[variable] might change faster than you publish your blog!*

*Here's the thing for me. I love to examine in discovering patterns and cadence from the past. When I say past, I'm talking Homo Habilis at Olduvai Gorge.* 

*When you examine a trajectory from ~ 2 MYA (Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania) to 74 KYA (Blombos Cave, South Africa) up to 11,900 years ago in (Anatolia/Turkey) a developmental pattern emerges.*

I can't help sharing how delightfully different the Anthropic Twins were to work with and how different the experience was talking with Claude Chat (aka CCh) and Claude Code (aka CC) view a CLI in vscode's terminal window. 

One of the things I found happened was that these twins were (a) good to work with, and (b) were and excellent source of entertainment. I found myself lapsing, as I'm want to do, into avenues of distraction. As an inter-sprint breather I would relax and recharge by posing a dialectic lead to drive to a synthesis using these twins. 

I worked with CCh and pottered towards a nice set of companion docs or an Arch Map and Implementation Guide. Then a moseyed over to CC and 



The Human coordinating the work between the the Claude Twins according to their strongest traits. The monitoring and management of Chimarism is a critical balancing act between donor cell (Graft) and Host. The Graft T-cell are needed to attack the diseased cells while dampening their abilities to attack healthy Host cells. The "doctor' will closely monitor to conduct and navigate through these dangerous waters.
