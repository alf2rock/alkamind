  So part of the evolution of re-tooling and rebuilding in the Age of Ai is to,
  in the words of Matatma Ganhi, "Be the Change you want to see in the world".
  If that works, we should try it. So this is the journal, which might become a
  story some day. 

  I've post the documentation that was use to technically rebuild the site. This post will be a journal of the journey This thread is about the relationships, and the fusing together of various models into a framework that I like to work within.

## If fan comes from fanatic, could fun come from fundamentals?

I've always been intrigued at boiling things down to their fundamental elements. One of my favourite paintings is 
**“The Alchemist Discovering Phosphorus, Joseph Wright of Derby" - Painted in 1771** 


![“The Alchemist Discovering Phosphorus, Joseph Wright of Derby"](/uploads/the-alkamist.jpg "“The Alchemist Discovering Phosphorus, Joseph Wright of Derby\"")

This painting cracked me up when I read the story behind it. Joseph depicts a pivotal moment (the discovery of the element phosphorus by the Hamburg alchemist **Hennig Brand** in **1669**) when "our Alchemist" transition from medieval alchemy to modern science in a sympathetic and romantic *light*. The story of Henning Brand is one where, in his quest for the Philosopher's Stone, by boiling a great quantity of urine, he stumbled into phosphorus.  The serendipity of this event is essentially a fusion of **determination and luck**. What our German chemist achieved was the discovery of a **fundamental element P (atomic 15).** 

How fun is that?

The same fun dynamics are playing out today with yet another **Age of {insert variable of choice]*,*** *but accelerating so fast that the \[variable] might change faster than you publish your blog!*

*Here's the thing for me. I love to examine the discovering patterns and cadence from the past.* 

*Whatever they end up calling this age, I think 2025 was near the start. The fun part for me is trying to connect the dots and having the inexhaustible determination of energy and luck collaborating with Ai.* 

*For me the question of, "What's the ratio of discovery of fossils to stone tools between Homo Habilis and the entire linage of* Australopithecus?" and "What's the time span of Homo Habilis compare to the entire linage of Australopithecus?" is as easy as asking "What is the difference of the dough hydration of a dough to make ciabatta and one to make lasagne noodles?". It turns out that the ratios for tools to fossils is huge for H. Habilis compared to their predecessors. 

So the fun starts on the synthesis trail in the pursuit of the truth. Just like the quest for the stone we might, with determination and luck, get to (metaphorically) boil a lot of urine. But what we stumble into is the *'handy man'* could have easily been Homo Curatix (female that cares for) or 'caring women'. 

The spark for that thought is the numerous quantity of stones. Why so many piles of stones. We've got: the warehouse of stones from the quarry, the flanks from the napping area were the stones were 'industriously' processed, then we have the cache area situated at the likely environmental boundary between trees and savanna which is ideal for scavenging site (yet another area for stones). 

That is an incredible leap in organizational design of specialized processers and skills. There was no service management tool for skills based routing! So where did this intensity of organizational design come from. 

So down the rabbit hole I went and came up with:

**Backstory**

1. Cataclysm: Change happens to survival
2. Find Refuge in a crisis. 
3. A bloom of diversity of Adaption in the Refugia in preparation for the "corridors of green"
4. Natural selection will Adopt the winners and select out all of the others "*according to Nature's Law*"
5. An emergence of some core fundamentals that proper the gradual grove of process, until it turns into a rut and the next calamity. 



So what does this mean to our stone count. Well I think there's plenty of evidence 2 MYA for steps 1 and 2. It is, however. my inference that females had to start elevating the traditional alloparenting in primates and likely 



*When I say past, I'm talking Homo Habilis at Olduvai Gorge type of past. For me this is the starting point because of the Olduwan Industry. I mean it's an oft quoted phase that their fossil record could fit in a shoe box. Not much evidence and any traces of aDNA is non-existent as far as I know.* 

*What does that leave us to imagine and infer from those musings.*

*So I mused, what was different from H. Habilis Stone Tools and their much more primitive **Australopithecus**.* 

*The numbers are huge for tool production when Homo enters the scene.*  



*I've always envisioned them as having developed a culture of care to support child birth with a group.*

*When you examine a trajectory from ~ 2 MYA (Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania) to 74 KYA (Blombos Cave, South Africa) up to 11,900 years ago in (Anatolia/Turkey) a developmental pattern emerges.* 

*Sept 1.*  






I can't help sharing how delightfully different the Anthropic Twins were to work with and how different the experience was talking with Claude Chat (aka CCh) and Claude Code (aka CC) view a CLI in vscode's terminal window. 

One of the things I found happened was that these twins were (a) good to work with, and (b) were and excellent source of entertainment. I found myself lapsing, as I'm want to do, into avenues of distraction. As an inter-sprint breather I would relax and recharge by posing a dialectic lead to drive to a synthesis using these twins. 

I worked with CCh and pottered towards a nice set of companion docs or an Arch Map and Implementation Guide. Then a moseyed over to CC and
