The monitoring and management of Chimarism is a critical balancing act between donor cell (Graft) and Host. The Graft T-cell are needed to attack the diseased cells while dampening their abilities to attack healthy Host cells. The "doctor' will closely monitor to conduct and navigate through these dangerous waters.
