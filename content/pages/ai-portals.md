Hypatia here will greet and guide you at the portal into the **Corridor of Delphi**, an interactive sanctuary where timeless wisdom meets modern insight. *"Know thyself"* — the ancient inscription at the Temple of Apollo beckons once more. Guided by Delphi herself — a young Athena-like presence who welcomes all who seek understanding — you'll embark on a journey of self-discovery through the Alkamind framework.

Within these marble halls, Tomomi will guide you to rooms dedicated to profound exploration:

- **The Know Thyself Chamber** — Discover your Belbin team role through thoughtful scenarios that reveal how you naturally contribute to collaborative endeavours
- **The Library** — A curated gallery of visual frameworks including the SECI knowledge spiral and temperament mappings that illuminate the patterns of human collaboration
- **The Corridor itself** — An ever-expanding space where new doors open to fresh insights

Whether you're a first-time visitor or a returning seeker, the Corridor remembers your journey and welcomes you back to continue where you left off.
