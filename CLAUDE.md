# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Alkamind website built with Nuxt 4 and Vue 3. This is a rebuild from a previous React-based site.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev       # Start dev server at http://localhost:3000
npm run build     # Build for production
npm run generate  # Generate static site
npm run preview   # Preview production build locally
```

## Architecture

This project uses Nuxt 4's app directory structure:

- `app/` - Main application code (Nuxt 4 convention)
  - `app.vue` - Root application component
  - `pages/` - File-based routing (create files here to add routes)
  - `components/` - Auto-imported Vue components
  - `layouts/` - Page layouts
  - `composables/` - Auto-imported composables
- `nuxt.config.ts` - Nuxt configuration
- `public/` - Static assets served at root

Nuxt auto-imports components, composables, and utilities - no manual imports needed for standard Nuxt features.
## added after auto-gen
That's auto-generated by Claude Code — it's a good base. You can enhance it with project-specific details. 

## Quick Addition

Add this section to the bottom of the existing file:

```markdown
## Project Context

**Client**: Alkamind Consulting Inc.
**Purpose**: Marketing website for Change Management & Application Development consultancy

## Branch Strategy (Option C)
- `main` — Production (live site) — DO NOT push directly during development

## Planned Integrations
- **Contentful CMS** — headless content management
- **Tailwind CSS** — styling
- **Netlify** — hosting with deploy previews
- **Calendly** — booking integration

## Design Requirements
- Clean, professional look
- Blue color scheme
- Mobile-responsive
- Fast loading (< 3 seconds)

## Environment Variables (to be added)
```
CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=xxx
CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=xxx
```
Never commit `.env` to git.

## Quick Reference: How to Ask for Changes

### Styling Tweaks
- "Make it darker" / "Use a warmer palette" / "Change the blue to navy"
- "Make the headline bigger" / "Smaller font for the subtext"
- "Add more padding" / "Too cramped, spread it out" / "More whitespace"
- "Use a more modern font" / "Make it bolder"
- "Add a subtle shadow" / "Round the corners" / "Make the button pop more"

### Layout Tweaks
- "Center this" / "Move it to the right" / "Align these in a row"
- "Put the contact section above the footer" / "Swap these two sections"
- "Hide this on mobile" / "Only show this on desktop"
- "Make this full width" / "Narrower content area"

### Content Tweaks
- "Change the headline to..." / "Update the phone number to..."
- "Add a tagline under the logo" / "Include an email link"
- "Remove the phone number" / "Get rid of that section"
- "Make this open in a new tab" / "Link this to the home page"

### Structure Tweaks
- "Create a new page for services"
- "Make this a reusable component" / "Extract the footer into its own component"
- "Add a nav bar" / "Put these links in a dropdown"
- "Use a two-column layout" / "Stack these vertically on mobile"

### Fixing Problems
- "This isn't working" / "The button doesn't do anything"
- "This looks broken on mobile" / "The spacing is off"
- "Revert that last change" / "Go back to how it was"
- "Why isn't this showing?" / "What's causing this error?"

### Pro Tips
- **Be specific when needed**: "Make the button blue" vs "Make the button #1B4F72"
- **Reference what you see**: "The thing on the right" / "The top section"
- **Say what you don't like**: "I don't like how this looks" — Claude will ask follow-ups
- **Compare**: "Make it look more like Apple's website" / "Less corporate, more friendly"
